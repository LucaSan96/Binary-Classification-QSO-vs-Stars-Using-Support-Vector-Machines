# **Binary Classification: QSO vs Stars Using Support Vector Machines**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the development of a binary classification project conducted as part of the Astroinformatics exam. The goal of the project is to classify celestial objects as Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) or stars using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a robust machine learning technique for binary classification tasks.

The project not only focuses on implementing and optimizing SVM models but also emphasizes practical data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data exploration techniques.

## **Learning Objectives**
During the project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Implementing and tuning an SVM model for binary classification tasks.
- **SQL Querying**: Extracting and managing data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** online database using structured SQL queries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and engineering suitable input features for the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Astroinformatics Applications**: Applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems in astronomy.

## **Dataset**
The dataset was obtained from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**, a comprehensive astronomical survey that provides detailed data on millions of celestial objects.  
The data was accessed through the SDSS online database using custom SQL queries to extract relevant features for classification, such as object magnitudes and redshift.
